# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Project
- Create a summary of the 2019 PyBer ride sharing data by the city type (Urban, Suburban, and Rural) to uncover meaningful insights. 
- Using Pandas and Matplotlib, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 
- Summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
